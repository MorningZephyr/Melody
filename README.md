**Piano Technique Master** - Revolutionizing piano education through technology and intelligent analysis.

Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser, or serve it with a local server:

```bash
# Using Python's built-in server
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

## How It Works

### 1. MIDI Parsing
- The backend uses `music21` to parse MIDI files
- Extracts note data including pitch, timing, and duration
- Separates left and right hand parts

### 2. Finger Assignment
- Automatically assigns optimal fingers based on note position
- Considers hand ergonomics and reach
- Different algorithms for left vs right hand

### 3. Hand Visualization
- SVG-based hand illustration with 5 fingers
- Highlights which finger should press which key
- Shows hand position and movement

### 4. Real-time Feedback
- Piano keys light up when pressed
- Fingers highlight to show which one to use
- Information panel shows current note and finger assignment

- [ ] Practice sequence generation
- [ ] Audio playback integration
- [ ] 3D hand models
- [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Multiple MIDI file support

## Technical Details

### Finger Assignment Logic
The app uses a simple algorithm based on note position within the octave:
- **Right Hand**: C/C# ‚Üí thumb, D/D# ‚Üí index, E/F ‚Üí middle, F#/G ‚Üí ring, G#/A/A#/B ‚Üí pinky
- **Left Hand**: Mirrored assignment for ergonomic playing

### Hand Visualization
- SVG-based hand with 5 finger circles
- Each finger can be highlighted independently
- Labels show finger numbers (T, 1, 2, 3, 4)

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/parse-midi` - Parse MIDI file and return note data with finger assignments
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

## Demo

The MVP includes sample data that demonstrates:
1. A C major scale (C4 to C5)
2. Finger assignments for each note
3. Hand visualization showing which finger to use
4. Real-time playback with finger highlighting
